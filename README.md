# Quake Strainer
Quake STrainer is my reverse engineering project of classic Quake.
It is still work in progress and evolving rapidly. 

## Goals
- develop my own toolkit for modding games
- implement basic hacks like for: unlimitted ammo, god mode, all weapons unlocked etc
- be able to use hacks by injecting DLL
- create script for patching binary with my trainer
